# TeamRecipe

We are Team Recipe and this is our school project as part of Software structures and models course.
Our main goal is to make a simple efficiently working recipe application that anyone can use to make own recipes and search other's recipes.
Users can also edit their allergies that they don't see the recipes with allergic ingredients.

If you have more questions about our applications email us at taturi@metropolia.fi
